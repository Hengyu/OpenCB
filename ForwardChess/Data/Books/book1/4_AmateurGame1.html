				<p class="heading-1">Too Fast</p>
                <hr /><br />
				<p class="normal">In chess, you are given two main resources: your pieces and time on your clock. Many spend a lifetime studying the former, but don’t give a second thought to learning how to wisely use the latter.</p>
				<p class="normal">Time management is an integral part of chess. There are two major areas: how you use your time for an entire game, and how you allocate time to each move. Both are important. To try your best you aim to use almost all your time each game. Players who play too slow for the situation often get into unnecessary time trouble and have to play too quickly in critical situations. But the majority of amateurs play too quickly – they buy all kinds of chess books, but then wonder why they aren’t much better after consistently spending 17 seconds on moves in a long time-control game. <span class="italic">You can’t play what you don’t see</span>, and you won’t see anything if you don’t take time to look.</p>
				<p class="normal">This chapter features games where one or both players played too fast, and examines the sometimes silly decisions that result from this lack of thought. The second chapter addresses games where players moved too slowly, and the perils they faced later in the game when they really needed their time. In my experience, about 60% of tournament and Internet Chess Club (ICC) players rated below 1600 FIDE play too fast, about 20% play too slow, and only about 20% seem to use about all their time each game without consistently getting into unnecessary time trouble.</p>
				<p class="normal">Tournament (and much Internet) chess almost always features time controls with increments or time delays. In an “N M” (e.g. 45 30) time control each side has N minutes to play the entire game, plus an increment of M seconds added after each move. In this book, the time remaining for each player (if available) is shown after each move; the great majority of the games are “time-stamped” this way. The amount of time taken by the player will often tell a crucial tale about how the game was played, and provide major insight into what the players were (or were not!) thinking. </p>
				<p class="normal"><span class="italic">Until you are rated about 1700, time management is one of the three big areas to concentrate on for chess improvement, the others being safety (tactics) and activity (using all your pieces all the time). The two key skills to work on are analysis and evaluation.</span></p>
				<p class="gameborder"><span class="bold">Game 1: White 1525 – Black 1587</span><br />Internet Chess Club 2012<br />50 minutes with a 50-second increment<br />French Defense, Tarrasch Variation</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,1,0)" name = "g0m1v0">1.e4</a> <span class="normal">50:43</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,2,0)" name = "g0m2v0">1...e6</a> <span class="normal">50:48<br /></span><a href="/SetMove(0,3,0)" name = "g0m3v0">2.d4</a> <span class="normal">51:27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,4,0)" name = "g0m4v0">2...d5</a> <span class="normal">51:36</span><br /><a href="/SetMove(0,5,0)" name = "g0m5v0">3.<span class="chess">N</span>d2</a> <span class="normal">52:06</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="indent">The characteristic move of the Tarrasch Variation. White has three major alternatives. Among these <a href="/SetMove(0,5,1)" name = "g0m5v1">3.<span class="chess">N</span>c3</a> (Classical) is by far the most popular. According to French Defense maven IM John Watson, the Classical is chosen in about 50% of international games, <a href="/SetMove(0,5,2)" name = "g0m5v2">3.e5</a> (Advance Variation) is played in about 25%, and the Tarrasch also about 25%. The third alternative, <a href="/SetMove(0,5,3)" name = "g0m5v3">3.exd5</a> (Exchange Variation), is rare at the master level due to its drawish nature, so strong players avoid it, but it is seen quite often among amateurs.</p>
				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,6,0)" name = "g0m6v0">3...<span class="chess">N</span>f6</a> <span class="normal">52:23</span></p>
				<p class="indent">One of the two major lines against the Tarrasch, the other being 3...c5. But there are many minor variations (3...<span class="chess">N</span>c6, 3...<span class="chess">B</span>e7, 3...a6), and Black could also transpose into a Rubinstein with 3...dxe4.</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,7,0)" name = "g0m7v0">4.e5</a> <span class="normal">52:34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,8,0)" name = "g0m8v0">4...<span class="chess">N</span>fd7</a> <span class="normal">53:08</span><br /><a href="/SetMove(0,9,0)" name = "g0m9v0">5.<span class="chess">B</span>d3</a> <span class="normal">52:41</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,10,0)" name = "g0m10v0">5...c5</a> <span class="normal">53:51</span></p>
				<p class="indent">The necessary pawn break. The famous Pointing Rule states that, <span class="italic">If the four central d- and e-pawns are all locked together, then place your hand across your two pawns. The direction they point indicates both where your preferable break move lies and the direction you wish to attack in.</span> </p>
				<p class="indent">In the current position White’s d- and e-pawns point kingside, so his break move is the eventual f4-f5 and he wishes to attack kingside. Black’s d- and e-pawns point queenside so his break is ...c7-c5 and he wants to attack queenside. Normally in the French, White has more space, but Black can more quickly achieve his break and start pressuring “his side” of the board.</p>
				<p class="indent">Inexperienced players who don’t know about pawn breaks often place their pieces, especially knights, in front of the break moves. This inevitably results in a cramped position where they sometimes complain, “I don’t know what to do.” That complaint is reasonable – there is often not much they can do once the damage is done, except learn about pawn breaks so that in future games they can use this idea to bring space and activity to their army.</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,11,0)" name = "g0m11v0">6.c3</a> <span class="normal">53:19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="indent">This move is almost automatic among stronger players. When Black breaks with ...c7-c5, he is threatening to weaken White’s pawn center with a later ...cxd4, so White hurries to have a pawn that can recapture on d4, thus fortifying e5 and his space advantage. If White delays this action even by one move, it is usually correct for Black to play ...cxd4 and force White to capture on d4 with a piece. This is one of the key ideas for Black in the French, and one reason why players who understand this for Black often get very good games quickly with the French against weaker opponents playing White.</p>
				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,12,0)" name = "g0m12v0">6...<span class="chess">N</span>c6</a> <span class="normal">54:36</span><br /><a href="/SetMove(0,13,0)" name = "g0m13v0">7.<span class="chess">N</span>e2</a> <span class="normal">53:52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="indent">This is the main line. There is also a gambit line with 7.<span class="chess">N</span>1f3, where White eventually gives up his d4-pawn for development, in a very similar manner to the Milner-Barry Gambit in the Advance French.</p>
				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,14,0)" name = "g0m14v0">7...<span class="chess">Q</span>b6</a> <span class="normal">54:43</span></p>

				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,18,0)" name = "g0m18v0">9...f6</a> <span class="normal">55:23</span></p>
				<p class="indent">Black thematically breaks again. The other major possibility is the old line <a href="/SetMove(0,18,5)" name = "g0m18v5">9...<span class="chess">B</span>b4+ </a><a href="/SetMove(0,19,5)" name = "g0m19v5">10.<span class="chess">B</span>d2 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,20,5)" name = "g0m20v5"><span class="chess">B</span>xd2+ </a><a href="/SetMove(0,21,5)" name = "g0m21v5">11.<span class="chess">Q</span>xd2 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,22,5)" name = "g0m22v5"><span class="chess">Q</span>b4</a>, forcing an endgame that is slightly better for White. Note that after 11...<span class="chess">Q</span>b4 White can castle or he can keep the king in the center and recapture after ...<span class="chess">Q</span>xd2+ with <span class="chess">K</span>xd2 since the center is stable and, with the queens off the board, the king should be both safe and active in the center.</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,19,0)" name = "g0m19v0">10.exf6</a> <span class="normal">52:12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="indent">Usually White captures on the ...f7-f6 break in the French since guarding e5 is problematic. Computer engine <span class="italic">Houdini</span> agrees, giving about a quarter-pawn preference to this move over the second best, 10.0-0. In return for giving up his center, White will get a semi-open e-file with a somewhat backward black e-pawn. (My definition of a backward pawn is <span class="italic">a pawn that, if you removed everything but the pawns from the board, has legal moves, but can’t continue to advance safely</span>. After 10...<span class="chess">N</span>xf6 Black cannot play ...e6-e5 without help from the other pieces, so the pawn on e6 is backward. Interested readers will find much more on understanding positional features in my book <span class="italic">Elements of Positional Evaluation.</span>) Experience has shown that Black in turn gets active play for his pieces. I have played both sides of similar positions successfully.</p>
				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,20,0)" name = "g0m20v0">10...<span class="chess">N</span>xf6</a> <span class="normal">55:35</span></p>
				<p class="indent">The standard recapture. The other possibility, <a href="/SetMove(0,20,6)" name = "g0m20v6">10...gxf6?!</a>, creates more pawns in the center and makes the e-pawn less backward, but leaves Black’s position, including his king, a little loose after <a href="/SetMove(0,21,6)" name = "g0m21v6">11.0-0</a>. <span class="italic">Houdini</span> goes so far as to evaluate White’s position after 11.0-0 as already possibly winning!</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,21,0)" name = "g0m21v0">11.0-0</a> <span class="normal">52:15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,22,0)" name = "g0m22v0">11...<span class="chess">B</span>d6</a> <span class="normal">56:12</span></p>
				<p class="indent">The most active square for the bishop. Black does not have to play the passive <a href="/SetMove(0,22,7)" name = "g0m22v7">11...<span class="chess">B</span>e7</a>, worrying about guarding the knight on f6 after a later <span class="chess">B</span>g5 because after Black castles kingside, the active rook on f8 will join the g7-pawn in guarding that knight.</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,23,0)" name = "g0m23v0">12.a3</a> <span class="normal">49:55</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="indent">This is a book line but, as you can tell from White’s time stamp, this is where he had exhausted his book knowledge. Both players have done a very good job navigating the opening. A crucial part of the game often begins when the pieces begin to clash and the players have to rely on their own analysis.</p>
				<p class="indent">After the game, White said that he was worried that if he developed his queen bishop (the main lines, such as 12.<span class="chess">B</span>g5), Black might be able to snatch the pawn on b2. While that is a legitimate concern, both grandmaster theory and computer analysis (which are merging these days) show that <a href="/SetMove(0,23,7)" name = "g0m23v7">12.<span class="chess">B</span>g5 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,24,7)" name = "g0m24v7"><span class="chess">Q</span>xb2</a> is risky after <a href="/SetMove(0,25,7)" name = "g0m25v7">13.<span class="chess">R</span>b1</a>, e.g. <a href="/SetMove(0,26,7)" name = "g0m26v7">13...<span class="chess">Q</span>a3 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,27,7)" name = "g0m27v7">14.<span class="chess">B</span>f4</a> with active play. But we can’t blame White for being concerned, since this is not a “refutation” and White has to rely on his evaluative judgment to see if this type of line is worth risking a pawn. Erring on the side of caution is not a bad idea, especially if the concern is losing material!</p>
				<p class="move">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/SetMove(0,24,0)" name = "g0m24v0">12...0-0</a> <span class="normal">56:44</span></p>
				<p class="indent">Black continues to play quickly, taking only 28 seconds for this reasonable move. At some point Black got past his book opening knowledge and had to start thinking. At that point it would be prudent to slow down, take time to look around to find better moves, and double-check the safety of the moves he is considering. </p>
				<p class="border">If you wish to be a better player, you have to find better moves, and if you don’t take time to look for better moves you can’t play them.</p>

				<p class="border">Botvinnik’s Rule for opening time management states, <span class="italic">“For a normal opening, take about 20% of your time for your first 15 moves.”</span> </p>
				<p class="indent">Clearly, for highly tactical openings that quickly take you out of “book,” more time should be taken. However, this rule was formulated before increments were standard and, in a game with a large increment (50 seconds), the math works out that Botvinnik’s Rule gives a bit too much time for the opening. It would imply that in this game the players can, on the average, have somewhat more than 80% of their time remaining on move 15, which works out to 40+ minutes. Despite the extra leeway, Black is still playing way too quickly, while White is probably in the rough ballpark of reasonable speed, given the increment and the number of book moves.</p>
				<p class="indent">After the exchanges, Black has freed his game and achieved at least full equality. I believe someone once stated, “If Black achieves easy equality then the momentum is on his side, and both players will feel that Black has the advantage.”</p>

				<p class="indent">The right idea but the wrong move. Black gets some credit for recognizing the criticality of this move and taking – for him – a “very long” four minutes for this aggressive choice. But the complexity and criticality (in this case a potentially big difference) between moves like <a href="/SetMove(0,32,12)" name = "g0m32v12">16...<span class="chess">B</span>xh2+</a> and the correct idea 16...<span class="chess">N</span>g4! would have justified his taking even longer.

				<p class="border">Sometimes a player (even someone strong and experienced) can fall in love with a move or idea and spend considerable time on it without taking a little time to look around and realize that a better alternative might be available.</p>
				<p class="indent">It turns out that <a href="/SetMove(0,32,13)" name = "g0m32v13">16...<span class="chess">N</span>g4!</a>, with an unstoppable double attack on both h2 and f2, wins fairly easily:</p>

				<p class="indent">I have noticed an interesting reaction among inexperienced players when someone makes a sacrifice similar to a classical bishop sacrifice. Instead of taking sufficient time on the previous move to see if this move should be allowed, they are surprised and take a long time deciding what to do about the “Greek Gift.” But calling this a Greek Gift is not apropos. That’s because <span class="italic">in chess this sacrifice almost always has to be accepted</span>, while the implication of a Trojan Horse is that (in real life) such a gift should<span class="italic"> not</span> be accepted!</p>
				<p class="indent">The logic for accepting the sacrifice is fairly easy: if you don’t capture the proffered bishop, then your opponent will be ahead in material and have a strong attack anyway. Therefore, since he is going to have a strong attack in either case, it makes sense to capture the bishop. That way you are ahead a piece, and you have some booty that you can possibly throw back at your opponent later to give some flexibility in fighting off the attack. Since strong players can win almost any game where they are ahead a pawn and have a strong attack, it makes sense, in a theoretical way, that the defender has to take the piece and see if he can hang on.</p>
				<p class="indent">Admittedly, there are exceptions where capturing the piece leads to an immediate forced mate or to the win of enormous amounts of material, but these situations are in the minority and should be fairly easily spotted. The bottom line is that when your opponent, in an otherwise even material situation, plays a move like 16...<span class="chess">B</span>xh2+, unless you see something immediately disastrous on the capture, you may as well not take too much time and accept the piece, and subsequently spend whatever time is necessary to defend ferociously.</p>

				<p class="underdiagram">White to play after 17...<span class="chess">N</span>g4+</p>
				<p class="normal">As you might expect from the position, this will be one of White’s most critical moves in the game – it is a more critical decision than whether he should have accepted the bishop on the previous move. Yet White, normally a slow player and having 44 minutes plus a 50-second increment to fall back upon, took only seven seconds (!) on this move:</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,35,0)" name = "g0m35v0">18.<span class="chess">K</span>g1??</a> <span class="normal">44:38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="normal">Delving into why White played 18.<span class="chess">K</span>g1 so fast, and what he should have done instead, hits at the heart of a big reason why amateurs are amateurs and identifies a key change many need to make in order to improve.</p>
				<p class="normal">After the game I asked White why he played his move so quickly and he replied, “<span class="italic">It looked too dangerous to go out to 18.</span><span class="chess">K</span><span class="italic">g3</span>.” In other words, he made his move quickly on a general principle: it is too dangerous to expose your king in the middle of the board with so many pieces around. I call this thought process error <span class="italic">“Hand-waving”</span> – that is, <span class="italic">using general principles to make a move in a position that calls for careful analysis. </span></p>
				<p class="normal">Hand-waving is an epidemic among weaker players, so it’s very helpful to identify it when it occurs so others can be aware and avoid making the same mistake. Hand-waving gets you in the habit of not doing critical analysis when necessary, even in long time-control games when plenty of time is available. Thinking this way in a blitz game is often not only acceptable, but necessary. However, in a slow game, failing to analyze (and, as a bad side effect, avoiding practicing how to analyze) in analytical positions not only avoids the work that is necessary to play strongly, but often points to the wrong answer.</p>
				<p class="normal">In this position, White had a choice of four moves: 18.<span class="chess">K</span>g1, 18.<span class="chess">K</span>g3, 18.<span class="chess">K</span>h1, and 18.<span class="chess">K</span>h3. While one of these, <a href="/SetMove(0,35,15)" name = "g0m35v15">18.<span class="chess">K</span>h3?</a>, can be immediately dismissed due to the discovered check <a href="/SetMove(0,36,15)" name = "g0m36v15">18...<span class="chess">N</span>e3+</a> winning White’s queen, it is not immediately clear which of the other three is best, especially since 17...<span class="chess">N</span>g4 attacks the f2 square three times and it is currently guarded only once. <span class="italic">The only way to differentiate among those moves is to check carefully what might happen after each one. The general principle might tell you which move to analyze first, but only concrete analysis can tell you which move to play</span> (for more on this subject, see “Principles of Analytical Efficiency” at <span class="hyperlink"><a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman103.pdf">http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman103.pdf</a></span>).</p>
				<p class="normal">It turns out that <a href="/SetMove(0,35,16)" name = "g0m35v16">18.<span class="chess">K</span>h1?!</a> is best met by <a href="/SetMove(0,36,16)" name = "g0m36v16">18...<span class="chess">N</span>xf2+ </a><a href="/SetMove(0,37,16)" name = "g0m37v16">19.<span class="chess">R</span>xf2</a> (forced) and now both 19...<span class="chess">R</span>xf2 and 19...<span class="chess">Q</span>xf2 give Black a good attack, e.g. <a href="/SetMove(0,38,16)" name = "g0m38v16">19...<span class="chess">R</span>xf2 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,39,16)" name = "g0m39v16">20.<span class="chess">B</span>d2 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,40,16)" name = "g0m40v16"><span class="chess">B</span>g4 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,41,16)" name = "g0m41v16">21.<span class="chess">N</span>f4 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,42,16)" name = "g0m42v16"><span class="chess">R</span>c8 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,43,16)" name = "g0m43v16">22.<span class="chess">B</span>xh7+ </a><a href="/SetMove(0,44,16)" name = "g0m44v16"><span class="chess">K</span>h8 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,45,16)" name = "g0m45v16">23.<span class="chess">Q</span>d3 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,46,16)" name = "g0m46v16"><span class="chess">Q</span>h6+ </a><a href="/SetMove(0,47,16)" name = "g0m47v16">24.<span class="chess">K</span>g1 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,48,16)" name = "g0m48v16"><span class="chess">R</span>xf4! </a><a href="/SetMove(0,49,16)" name = "g0m49v16">25.<span class="chess">B</span>xf4 </a><a href="/SetMove(0,50,16)" name = "g0m50v16"><span class="chess">Q</span>xf4</a> with a good position for Black.</p>
				<p class="normal">But ironically the “exposed” <a href="/SetMove(0,35,17)" name = "g0m35v17">18.<span class="chess">K</span>g3!</a> is best.

				<p class="normal">White may not have found 18.<span class="chess">K</span>g3! had he taken more than 7 seconds and not hand-waved but, while practice does not make perfect, practice sure makes better. This was an excellent opportunity to practice some very critical analysis!</p>

				<p class="normal">Armed with this insightful time-stamping data, it’s no wonder I sometimes tell students who use their time this way, “You’ve got chess backwards. You are supposed to take your time on complicated, critical moves, and play the other moves relatively more quickly, saving time for when you need it.” GM Jonathan Rowson wrote something similar in <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Chess Sins</span> (I paraphrase): “<span class="italic">If you take more time on a move your analysis will improve, but taking more time won’t improve your judgment.</span>” So take less time on judgment moves and more time on analytical moves.</p>
				<p class="normal"><span class="italic">Houdini</span> thinks <a href="/SetMove(0,53,28)" name = "g0m53v28">27.<span class="chess">Q</span>xc1</a> is slightly better, but if the decision is that close, taking almost seven minutes to choose will almost never be worth it. </p>

				<p class="normal">Although placing pawns on the opposite color of an opponent’s bishop is logical, <span class="italic">Houdini</span> thinks <a href="/SetMove(0,56,29)" name = "g0m56v29">28...b6</a> is slightly preferable. But preferable only by a tenth of a pawn, not comparable to the 17-pawn mistake Black made at move 18! <span class="italic">You should not be penny-wise and pound-foolish by working on your subtle problems when you get the most bang for your buck from fixing your big problems – usually those involving safety</span>.</p>

				<p class="normal">White again offers a trade of pieces when behind, but it’s not so bad because he is only down a pawn and an endgame with bishops of opposite colors looms. It is very helpful to understand the most common exceptions to the “trade down when winning” principle. Trading towards bishops of opposite colors is a strong exception, since that is the most difficult endgame to win when ahead a pawn or two – or sometimes <br />three!</p>

				<p class="normal">Black retreats the queen to the same square from which it came. This could either be a draw offer (the position has to be repeated three times, not two), an attempt to gain time on the clock (unlikely), or just an attempt to look around before trying something different in the effort to win.</p>
				<p class="move"><a href="/SetMove(0,61,0)" name = "g0m61v0">31.<span class="chess">N</span>d2</a> <span class="normal">19:31&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p>
				<p class="normal">Why not? White is the one down the pawn and struggling to draw. If repeating the position is not clearly a mistake allowing the opponent a second chance at a missed opportunity (and here it is not a mistake), why not repeat? <span class="italic">Houdini</span> analyzes <a href="/SetMove(0,61,31)" name = "g0m61v31">31.<span class="chess">Q</span>g4</a> as slightly better than 31.<span class="chess">N</span>d2, but I probably would have played 31.<span class="chess">N</span>d2 rather quickly to see if Black has the wished-for peaceful intent.</p>

				<p class="normal">All the fireworks took place earlier. I guess Black decided that it was not worth trying to win, although he has 80% of his time still available. This is the type of position where good players with Black would try to grind down the best of opponents with the feeling, “What have I got to lose? I am ahead a pawn, have plenty of time, and the chances of me winning are a lot better than my chances of losing. At the very least I’ll get a draw, so I have nothing to lose playing on for a while.”</p>
				<p class="normal">One of the few draws in the book. A positive aspect to amateur games: they are often so naturally unbalanced that “too many draws” is not a problem for the spectators.</p>
