                The theory of the most fashionable openings is now being updated to cover the first
                30 moves, and even the first 40. The main purchasers of opening monographs are
                candidate masters and club players. Not many of them are looking to fill their heads
                with far too much information. So, understandably, they want to deviate from the
                main lines as soon as possible and prefer to choose half-forgotten variations. Contrary 
                to the opinion of official theory, these variations are sometimes no worse than
                the “sophisticated” ones. Not even the objective shortcomings of such rarities should
                frighten you away from trying them in practice – as besides the classical time control
                there’s also Rapidplay and Blitz.
                <p>
                Eleven opening systems are presented in this work. The authors play White more
                strictly than Black, and with the ten plans for Black there’s just one for White (the
                French with <span class="chess">I</span>g4 in chapter 6). 
                Seven chapters were created by Alexander Raetsky
                and four by Maxim Chetverik. We have frequently used games and analyses that
                haven’t been published before.
                <p>
                The authors are sticking with forms of exposition that are identical to those in
                our previous Russian-language works The Catalan and The Queen’s Gambit Accepted
                – games with notes and illustrative individual lines in the systems. If the duels don’t
                go over the limit of 30 moves they’re included in full, otherwise they’re “cut” at
                the point when the course of the battle no longer has any relation to the opening.
                Without disregarding the computer’s prescriptions, we’ve tried not to go overboard
                with specific variations and have given preference to explanations. Explaining the
                configuration of forces and the plans for both players is like hiring a navigator in the
                unfamiliar waters of rare systems.
                <p>
                Hopefully the reader, armed with the unusual openings we suggest, will enjoy setting 
                fashions rather than merely following them.
