        <h2>The King’s Gambit</h2>
        <p>The Immortal Game was a chess game played on 21 June 1851 by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky. 
        The very bold sacrifices made by Anderssen to finally secure victory have made it one of the most 
        famous chess games of all time. Anderssen gave up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, checkmating his
        opponent with his three remaining minor pieces. It has been called
        an achievement perhaps unparalleled in chess literature.<p>
        <br />1.<a href="/SetMove(1,0)" name="m1v0"><b>e4</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(2,0)" name="m2v0"><b>e5</b></a> 2.<a href="/SetMove(3,0)" name="m3v0"><b>f4</b></a> 
        <p> This is the King's Gambit: Anderssen offers his pawn in exchange for faster development. Although this was a common opening in the nineteenth century, it is less common today, as defensive techniques have improved since Anderssen's time 
        <p> 2...<a href="/SetMove(4,0)" name="m4v0"><b>exf4</b></a> 
        <p> Kieseritzky accepts the gambit; this variant is thus called the King's Gambit Accepted. 
        <p> 3.<a href="/SetMove(5,0)" name="m5v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>c4</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(6,0)" name="m6v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>h4+?!</b></a> 
        <p> Black's move will force White to move his king and White will not be able to castle, but this move also places Black's queen in peril, and White can eventually attack it with gain of tempo with <span class="chess">C</span>g1-f3. 
        <p> 4.<a href="/SetMove(7,0)" name="m7v0"><b><span class="chess">K</span>f1</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(8,0)" name="m8v0"><b>b5</b></a> 
        <p> This is the Bryan Counter-gambit, deeply analysed by Kieseritzky, and which sometimes bears his name. It is not considered a sound move by most players today. 
        <p> 5.<a href="/SetMove(9,0)" name="m9v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>xb5</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(10,0)" name="m10v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>f6</b></a> 6.<a href="/SetMove(11,0)" name="m11v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>f3</b></a> 
        <p> This is a common developing move, but the knight now attacks Black's queen, forcing Black to protect it instead of developing his own side. 
        <p> 6...<a href="/SetMove(12,0)" name="m12v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>h6</b></a> 7.<a href="/SetMove(13,0)" name="m13v0"><b>d3</b></a> 
        <p> With this move, White now has solidified control over the critical center of the board. German grandmaster Robert Hübner recommends 7. <span class="chess">C</span>c3 instead. 
        <p> 7...<a href="/SetMove(14,0)" name="m14v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>h5</b></a> 
        <p> This move threatens <span class="chess">C</span>g3+, and it protects the pawn at f4, but it also sidelines the knight to a poor position at the edge of the board, where knights are the least powerful. 
        <p> 8.<a href="/SetMove(15,0)" name="m15v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>h4</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(16,0)" name="m16v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>g5</b></a> 
        <p> Better was 8. ... g6, according to Kieseritzky. 
        <p> 9.<a href="/SetMove(17,0)" name="m17v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>f5</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(18,0)" name="m18v0"><b>c6</b></a> 
        <p> This simultaneously unpins the queen pawn and attacks the bishop. However, some have suggested 9. ... g6 would be better, to deal with a very troublesome knight. Notice how the players in those days developed one or two pieces, then moved them again and again. 
        <p> 10.<a href="/SetMove(19,0)" name="m19v0"><b>g4</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(20,0)" name="m20v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>f6</b></a> 11.<a href="/SetMove(21,0)" name="m21v0"><b><span class="chess">G</span>g1!</b></a> 
        <p> This is an advantageous passive piece sacrifice. If Black accepts, his queen will be moved away from the action, giving White a lead in development. 
        <p> 11...<a href="/SetMove(22,0)" name="m22v0"><b>cxb5?</b></a> 
        <p> Hübner believes this was Black's critical mistake; this gains material, but loses in development, at a point where White's strong development is able to quickly mount an offensive. Hübner recommends 11. ... h5 instead. 
        <p> 12.<a href="/SetMove(23,0)" name="m23v0"><b>h4!</b></a> 
        <p> White's knight at f5 protects the pawn, which is attacking Black's queen. 
        <p> 12...<a href="/SetMove(24,0)" name="m24v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>g6</b></a> 13.<a href="/SetMove(25,0)" name="m25v0"><b>h5</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(26,0)" name="m26v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>g5</b></a> 14.<a href="/SetMove(27,0)" name="m27v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>f3</b></a> 
        <p> White (Anderssen) now has two threats:
        <br />
        <br />* <span class="chess">E</span>xf4, which will trap Black's queen (the queen has no safe place to go),
        <br />* e5, which would attack Black's knight at f6 while simultaneously exposing an attack by White's queen on the unprotected black rook at a8. 
        <p> 14...<a href="/SetMove(28,0)" name="m28v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>g8</b></a> 
        <p> This deals with the threats, but undevelops Black even further — now the only Black piece not on its starting square is the queen, which is about to be put on the run, while White has control over a great deal of the board. 
        <p> 15.<a href="/SetMove(29,0)" name="m29v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>xf4</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(30,0)" name="m30v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>f6</b></a> 16.<a href="/SetMove(31,0)" name="m31v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>c3</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(32,0)" name="m32v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>c5</b></a> 
        <p> An ordinary developing move by Black, which also attacks the rook at g1. 
        <p> 17.<a href="/SetMove(33,0)" name="m33v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>d5!?</b></a> 
        <p> White responds to the attack with a counter-attack. This move threatens <span class="chess">C</span>c7, which would fork the king and rook. Richard Réti recommends 17. d4 ... 18. <span class="chess">C</span>d5, which results in an advantage for White. 
        <p> 17...<a href="/SetMove(34,0)" name="m34v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>xb2</b></a> 
        <p> Black gains a pawn, and threatens to gain the rook at a1 with check. 
        <p> 18.<a href="/SetMove(35,0)" name="m35v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>d6!</b></a> 
        <p> With this move White offers to sacrifice both his rooks. Hübner comments that, from this position, there are actually many ways to win, and he believes there are at least three better moves than 18. <span class="chess">E</span>d6: 18. d4, 18. <span class="chess">E</span>e3, or 18. <span class="chess">G</span>e1, which lead to strong positions or checkmate without needing to sacrifice so much material. The commercial version of the chess-playing computer program Junior recommends 18. <span class="chess">C</span>c7+, followed by <span class="chess">G</span>e1. Garry Kasparov has pointed out that the world of chess would have lost one of its 'crown jewels' if the game had continued in such an unspectacular fashion. The <span class="chess">E</span>d6 move is unusual, because White is willing to give up so much material. 
        <p> 18...<a href="/SetMove(36,0)" name="m36v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>xg1?</b></a> 
        <p> It is from this move that Black's defeat stems. Wilhelm Steinitz suggested in 1879 that a better move would be 18... <span class="chess">I</span>xa1+; likely moves to follow are 19. <span class="chess">K</span>e2 <span class="chess">I</span>b2 20. <span class="chess">K</span>d2 <span class="chess">E</span>xg1. 
        <p> 19.<a href="/SetMove(37,0)" name="m37v0"><b>e5!</b></a> 
        <p> This sacrifices yet another White rook. More importantly, this move blocks the Queen from participating in the defense of her king, and threatening mate in 2: 19. <span class="chess">C</span>xg7+ <span class="chess">K</span>d8 20. <span class="chess">E</span>c7#. 
        <p> 19...<a href="/SetMove(38,0)" name="m38v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>xa1+</b></a> 20.<a href="/SetMove(39,0)" name="m39v0"><b><span class="chess">K</span>e2</b></a> 
        <p> At this point, Black's attack has run out of power; Black has a queen and bishop on the back rank, but cannot effectively mount an immediate attack on White, while White can storm forward. According to Kieseritzky, he resigned at this point. Hübner notes that an article by Friedrich Amelung in the journal Baltische Schachblaetter, 1893, reported that Kiesertizky probably played 20. ... <span class="chess">C</span>a6, but Anderssen then announced the mating moves. In any case, it is suspected that the last few moves were not actually played on the board in the original game. 
        <p> 20...<a href="/SetMove(40,0)" name="m40v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>a6</b></a> 
        <p> The Black Knight covers the c7 square as White was threatening 21. <span class="chess">C</span>xg7+ <span class="chess">K</span>d8 and 22. <span class="chess">E</span>c7#. Another attempt to defend would be 20... <span class="chess">E</span>a6 allowing the Black King to flee via <span class="chess">K</span>c8 and <span class="chess">K</span>b7, although White has enough with the continuation 21. <span class="chess">C</span>c7+ <span class="chess">K</span>d8 and 22 <span class="chess">C</span>xa6 where now on 22... <span class="chess">I</span>xa2 to defend f7 against <span class="chess">E</span>c7+, <span class="chess">C</span>d6+ and <span class="chess">I</span>f7#, White can play 23. <span class="chess">E</span>c7+ <span class="chess">K</span>e8 24. <span class="chess">C</span>b4 d5 25. <span class="chess">C</span>d6+ and White wins or 22... <span class="chess">E</span>b6 (preventing <span class="chess">E</span>c7+) 23. <span class="chess">I</span>a8 <span class="chess">I</span>c3 24. <span class="chess">I</span>xb8 <span class="chess">I</span>c8 25. <span class="chess">I</span>xc8 <span class="chess">K</span>xc8 26. <span class="chess">E</span>f8 h6 27. <span class="chess">C</span>d6+ <span class="chess">K</span>d8 28. <span class="chess">C</span>xf7+ <span class="chess">K</span>e8 29. <span class="chess">C</span>xh8 <span class="chess">K</span>xf8 with a winning endgame for White. 
        <p> 21.<a href="/SetMove(41,0)" name="m41v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>xg7+</b></a> <a href="/SetMove(42,0)" name="m42v0"><b><span class="chess">K</span>d8</b></a> 22.<a href="/SetMove(43,0)" name="m43v0"><b><span class="chess">I</span>f6+!</b></a> 
        <p> This beautiful Queen sacrifice forces Black to give up his defense of e7. 
        <p> 22...<a href="/SetMove(44,0)" name="m44v0"><b><span class="chess">C</span>xf6</b></a> 23.<a href="/SetMove(45,0)" name="m45v0"><b><span class="chess">E</span>e7</b></a> 
        <p> At the end, Black is ahead in material by a considerable margin: a queen, two rooks and a bishop. But the material does not help Black. White has been able to use his remaining pieces - two knights and a bishop - to force mate.
        <br />
        <br />Savielly Tartakower described this as a 'beautiful game'.
